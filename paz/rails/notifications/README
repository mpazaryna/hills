== Welcome to Notifications

Notifications is a small sample app that is being used to demonstrate and review
Rails logging.

== GEMS

* itslog https://github.com/johnnytommy/itslog

== Helpful rake commands

* rake log:clear

== Requirements

1. Modify the command log to hold incoming request information (xml or json body)
2. Modify the command log to hold incoming request headers
3. Modify the command log to hold incoming request url
4. The command log should also hold an entry for reads (so we have records of incoming requests for reads)
