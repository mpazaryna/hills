## Imperative code
- how to do it
- step by step - take number, loop
- walk into a restaurant example
- walk in - pull out the chair - read the menu - motion to the waiter

## Declarative code
- what to do
- for example using the reduce function
- the reduce function is an abstraction over the loop
- much more readable
- walk in say we need a table for two and the waiter takes over

## Side effects
- in imperative it's more up to you to keep track of things

## Composition
program your brain in terms of components
start thinking about how you break something down into components
Compose larger compoents of smaller components

## The react meme
- Focused
- Independent
- Reusuable
- Small
- Testable

## React
- It's just javascript

## React & JQuery
- JQuery the state is in the dom
- React, we take the state outside of the DOM and then rendered for the DOM

## Webpack
- a way of bundling your work
- a way of transforming js and run transformations to get it into a single file

## Bable
- allows for transformations on the js
- jsx is must be converted through the use of babel using the loader

props are to components what arguments are to functions.
the code that gets returned from our render method is a representation of what the real DOM should look like.

f(d)=V. A Function takes in some Data and returns a View.

Array.prototype.map
- creates a new array,
- calls our callback function on each item in the array,
- and fills the new array with the result of calling the callback function on each item.

## Stateless Functional Components
- allows the code above to be written as normal functions

## Functional Programming
- Pure functions always return the same result given the same arguments.
- Pure function's execution doesn't depend on the state of the application.
- Pure functions don't modify the variables outside of their scope.
- Abide by the rules and it minimizes side effects

## Pure Functions  
- evaluate same result
- doesnâ€™t modify outside of scope
- minimizes side effects
- react the flow is fn(d)=v  take a function give it data and it returns a view
- pure functions - take in props and render a UI
- does not contain other function invocations
- easy to test
- easy to reuse
- the render method is a pure function

this.props.children is an array of components rather than just a single component,
since there are multiple components nested.

If you're using React correctly, you're going to notice you have a lot of
components that simply take in some data via props and output some UI

The reason for this is because a really great paradigm to get used to is
separating your components into container components and presentational
components, with presentational components optionally taking in some data
and rendering a view

Notice React passes props to your function as the first argument to the function.
This is a lot cleaner and makes creating React components more natural since
you're literally just making a function. It's a good idea to try to use as
many Stateless Functional Components as possible because then you have a
good separation of presentational components vs other components.

## Prop Types
- The middle ground in terms of type checking properties that are passed to your components.
- Improves the ability to add documentation to a component.
- Props can be passed to react-router

## this is a object

    var styles = {
      transparentBg: {
        background: 'transparent'
      }  
    };

    modules.exports = styles;

## Containers
- manages state and routing
- does not manage the rendering of the UI
- encourages the separation of the business logic from the presentational logic

## Stateless Functional Components
- allows for the presentation components to just be functions, not react classes

## Lifecycle

We've talked about how the Render method in a React component needs to be a  
pure function. That means it needs to be stateless, it needs to not make any  
Ajax requests, etc. It should just receive state and  
props and then render a UI.  

Lifecycle methods are special methods
- each component can have
- that allow us to hook into the views when specific conditions happen
- example: when the component first renders
- example: when the component gets updated with new data, etc

### You can really break React's Life Cycle Methods down into two categories.

1. When a component gets mounted to the DOM and unmounted.

By definition then, these methods will be invoked only once during the life  
of the component.

Here are some things that we may need to do:
- Establish some default props in our component
- Set some initial state in our component
- Make an Ajax request to fetch some data needed for this component
- Set up any listeners (ie Websockets or Firebase listeners)
- Remove any listeners you initially set up (when unmounted)

Establish some default props in our component:
  getDefaultProps: function ()

Set some initial state in our component
  getInitialState: function ()

Make an Ajax request to fetch some data needed for this component
  componentDidMount: function ()

This will get called right after the component is mounted to the DOM.

Set up any listeners (ie Websockets or Firebase listeners)
   componentDidMount: function ()

Remove any listeners you initially set up (when unmounted)
   componentWillUnmount: function ()     

2. When a component receives new data.

  componentWillReceiveProps
  shouldComponentUpdate

Container component contains logic
Presentational Component renders the ui

# this keyword in javascript

Implicit binding
Explicit binding
new binding
window binding

ask yourself where is the function being invoked.

Implicit binding is
left of the dot at call time

Explicit binding
call, apply, binding

New binding

.map allows for looping over the members of an array

console.log()
return a promise, when that promise resolves return players

.bind allows you to set a context
