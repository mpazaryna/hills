Did You Know That You Can Tie RSS Feeds into PageGate
</title>
<description>
Using our RSS2SQL PHP script, you can have your RSS Feed write information to an SQL database. You can then use linked tables to tie that SQL database to PageGate's database. If you code it properly, any time you post an update to your RSS Feed, the SQL integration will automatically tell PageGate to send a message.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.notepage.net/did-you-know-you-can-tie-an-rss-feed-into-pagegate.htm" target="_blank" >Did You That You Can Tie an RSS Feed into PageGate</a>

<title>Production and Use of Sound Effects</title>
<description>
Sound effects are artificially created or enhanced sounds that are used in artistic works to emphasize or express an action, mood, or feeling. Sound effects were initially used in radio dramas, but can be observed more often today in podcasts, theater, films, and television shows. They are often synchronized with certain actions, such as a doors slamming being accompanied by the appropriate noise. Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other emotions.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/production-and-use-sound-effects.htm" target="_blank" >Production and Use of Sound Effects</a>

<title>Dangers in Blogging</title>
<description>
I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. <br /> <br /> Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not consider that they too can be targeted. <br /> <br /> Females, in particular, should be cautious when circumnavigating the blogosphere. If you are a blogger or contemplating an online journal, consider these tips to protecting your identity: <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/dangers-blogging.htm" target="_blank" >complete article</a>

<title>Podcast Sermons</title>
<description>
The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances. Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.<br /> <br /> The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders that communities have become accustom to. Using technology as a communication medium has not been lost on spiritual leaders and many have embraced the Internet as a medium to spread their faith. It is rare to find a house of worship that does not have a website or Internet presense. Expanding upon this theme, parishes looked to podcasting to further expanded the reach of their spiritual counselors and ministers. Many preachers record homilies, hymns, services, sermons or gospel teachings, for parishioners and interested listeners.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/podcasting-sermons.htm" target="_blank" >Podcast Sermons</a>

<title>Personal RSS Feed Namespaces</title>
<description>
The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements tags in any RSS feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/personal-namespace.htm" target="_blank" >complete article</a>

<title>Podcast Audio Recording Tips</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
Before you begin podcasting develop a plan and a format for your show. Determine the focus of your podcast and what types of guests you would like to interview. Time spent planning your show will contribute to its success.<br />
 <b></b><br />
 <b>Location, Location, Location</b><br />
 When you are producing a podcast on a regular basis it is important that you select an appropriate location for the recording to take place. The location should be free of external distractions and relatively quiet. It is easiest if you use the same location each time, that way the equipment can remain in place and will not require moving or setup each time you produce a show.<br />

<title>The Dangers of Blogging</title>
<description>
I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. <br /> <br /> Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/dangers-blogging.htm" target="_blank" >Dangers of Blogging</a>

<title>Publicize Your RSS Feed</title>
<description>
There is little argument from webmasters and publishers that RSS brings in traffic. So once you've made the leap and created a feed, how do you tell your visitors about the feed?<br /> <br /> <b> 1. Submit Your RSS Feed to RSS Directories. </b><br /> This will not only increase the number of sites linking to your website and increasing your link popularity, it will also increase the RSS feeds profile. A number of RSS search engines and RSS directories exist that allow you to freely submit RSS feeds. Feeds are generally categorized and grouped together by subject. Web surfers looking for RSS feeds about a specific subject will often search the RSS directories, to locate a feed that matches their specific criteria. Topic specific RSS feed and podcasting directories are also emerging. Choose a web feed's category carefully and only submit relevant feeds to topic specific directories.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/publicize-your-rss-feed.htm" target="_blank" >Publicize Your RSS Feed</a>

 Here are some other things to pay attention to when selecting domain names... <br />
 <b></b><br />
 <b>1. Domain Extensions</b><br />
 Many webmasters wrestle not only with choosing the best domain name, but also with the decision of what domain extensions to select for their website. The following is a general guide to what the most popular domain extensions represent...<br />
 <br />
 .com - commercial (by far, the most popular domain extension)<br />
 .net - network host (often used by hosting companies)<br />
 .edu - educational institution<br />
 .org - organization<br />
 .info - informational sites<br />
 <br />
 If your primary focus is in a local market, you may find value in a local domain as well.<br />

 <b>Tips to Get Things Accomplished </b><br />
 All of us start the day with every intention of completing a variety of tasks, but unfortunately many of us become distracted as the day moves on. Or even worse, we are tasked with crisis management, and at the end of the day we find that we have made little progress in whittling down the days planned tasks. As well intentioned as you may be, it seems to become a routine, and one that far too many of us fall into. <br />

 <b>Small Businesses Must Adapt or Suffer</b><br />
 Small businesses tend to be more agile than large corporations, but in order to take advantage of that strength, they must be willing to adapt with changing times in order to prosper and survive. This is especially true when faced with a difficult economic climate. <br />

<title>Website Spidering</title>
<description>
Website Spidering refers to the automated process of indexing a web site by a search engine. An automated program, known as a web crawler or spider, will go through a website following the links on each page, and will gather pertinent information from each page until it has properly indexed the entire website.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.small-business-software.net/website-spidering.htm" target="_blank" >Website Spidering</a>

<title>2011 Reflections, 2012 Predictions</title>
<description>
No country suffered more than Japan in 2011. Japan was rocked by an 8.9 earthquake, then a tsunami that was created from the quake hit the small island. The tsunami caused significant damage to one of Japans power plants making it impossible to properly cool or shutdown the nuclear reactor. The inability to cool the nuclear plant resulted in a nuclear melt down, and the escape of radiation. When the trifecta hit, the Japanese people earned the world's respect, they managed the tragedy with stoicism and grace. The consequences of this horrible tragedy, and implications of the radiation leaks, into the sea and atmosphere are still unknown. Japan will bear the scars from 2011, for generations to come.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.small-business-software.net/2011-reflections-2012-predictions.htm" target="_blank" >complete article</a>

 <b>2. Smart Mobility</b><br />

 Mobile phones have become smart devices, they are more than just phones and alarm clocks. By the end of 2012, it will be hard to find a phone that does not run games, support Internet connections and have built in web browser.<br />

 <b>3. Multi-Function Devices</b><br />

 I suspect that devices will begin merging, there is no longer a need for so many gadgets. The functionality of the devices from smart phones, kindles, ipads and computers are redundant and there is likely to be device consolidation as the overlap in functionality increases. <br />

<title>Audio File Optimization Tips</title>
<description>
Optimize your audio files to increase their popularity, just as you would optimize a website. Audio search engines are becoming more advanced as audio files become more commonplace on the Internet. Here are some tips to optimize your audio offerings...<br /> <br /> <b>1. Optimize Landing Page</b><br /> <br /> Create a landing page for the audio files. The landing page should explain the audio content and encourage subscriptions. Outline the steps the visitor should take in order to subscribe or listen to the audio file. Make an effort to interact with the visitor on the landing page, and make it as easy as possible for them to subscribe or listen to your podcast. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/audio-file-optimization-tips.htm" target="_blank" >Audio File Optimization Tips</a>

<title>Blog Tips for SEO</title>
<description>
Blogs are the current rage, and many webmasters have blogs but fail to use their blog to its full potential. Blogs provide a steady stream of fresh content, and if this content is written and managed properly, blogs have the ability to increase a website's ranking in the search engines.<br /> <br /> <b>1. Host Your Own Blog</b><br /> In order to prosper from a blog, be sure to host it on your own domain. Hosting the blog on your own server will maximize the links to your website. Link popularity is one of the factors search engines use to rank websites. Resist the urge to use free hosting services, do not give away your link popularity!<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/blog-tips-for-seo.htm" target="_blank" >Blog Tips for SEO</a>

<title>Power of Sound Effects</title>
<description>
Sound effects are often used to compliment and enhance artistic presentations, whether they be podcasts, videos, or other audio/visual productions. Royalty-free sound effects are typically non-exclusive and can be used by anyone who purchases them. Professional sound effects can give a podcast or production a more professional sound. However, many new producers may not realize that sound effects have copyrights, and in many cases it is illegal to use a sound effect that you happen to find on the web without properly licensing it.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/power-of-audio.htm" target="_blank" >Sound Effects and the Power of Audio</a><br /> <br /> Find sound effects at <a href="http://www.digital-sound-effects.com" target="_blank" >Digital Sound Effects</a>

<title>Dangers of Blogging</title>
<description>
I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored.<br /> <br /> Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not consider that they too can be targeted. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/dangers-blogging.htm" target="_blank" >Dangers of Blogging</a>

<title>10 Podcast Tips to a Great Sound</title>
<description>
What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or break a podcast. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/top-podcasting-great-sound.htm" target="_blank" >10 Podcast Tips to a Great Sound</a>

In addition the costs involved in creating and managing an RSS feed are insignificant when compared to the print advertising Realtors spend on each week. Imagine the amount spent each week to promote various properties in circulars and weekly newspapers, compared to the costs associated with updating and managing an RSS feed.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/realtors-use-rss.htm" target="_blank" >RSS for Selling Homes</a>

<title>RSS Extensions</title>
<description>
One of the benefits to the RSS 2.0 specification is it's expandability. RSS 2.0 extensions are often called namespaces. Namespaces allow for users or companies to create new tags or elements.<br /> <br /> The RSS 2.0 specification goes into detail about how namespaces can be documented to prevent confusion and overlap. The extendibility of the specifications allow a number of industries to use the standard and enhance it, with their specific needs without causing undue confusion or problems, with the original specification. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/rss-extensions.htm" target="_blank" >RSS Extensions</a>

<title>Technology Has Spawned Industries</title>
<description>
The technical search giant, Google, alone is the inspiration and sole cause behind the creation of thousands of new businesses. There are now companies dedicated solely to Pay-Per-Click campaign management. Thousands of individuals and companies now make money through search engine optimization and outsourcing their services to improve website rankings, specifically to see that a website ranks well in Googles organic search results. There are now software applications that can determine what keywords to use in optimizing a website for search engine rankings, and other software programs that assess and evaluate website traffic and popularity. These products and businesses were all brought to fruition as a result of Googles Internet search domination and technical stature.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.small-business-software.net/technology-has-spawned-industries.htm" target="_blank" >Technology Has Spawned Industries</a>

<title>ABCs of RSS Feeds</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
Implementing RSS (Really Simple Syndication) can be aided by an understanding of the terms relating to RSS. Learn the ABCs of RSS....<br />
 <br />
 <b>A - AutoDiscovery</b><br />
 <br />
 Auto Discovery is code that is inserted into the header of an HTML web page, which then indicates to readers that an RSS feed is available for the content.<br />
 <br />
 <b>B - Blogs</b><br />
 <br />
 Blogs are web logs that are updated regularly, usually on a daily basis. Blogs generally contain information related to a specific topic. In some cases, blogs are used as daily diaries about people's personal lives, political views, or even as social commentaries. The truth of the matter is that blogs can be shaped into whatever the author wants them to be. While initially thought of as diaries or online journals, blogs have evolved into the latest fresh web content. <br />

<title>Emotion of Color in Web Design</title>
<description>
Color psychology is a phrase used to describe the effect that <i>color </i>has on human behavior. The psychology of color is certainly not a new concept. In fact, it has been around for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Colors tend to carry non-verbal and subliminal messages, and the color spectrum evokes different emotions and physiological responses in people. The reactions people have to specific colors may be influenced by many factors, including their culture, location, gender, or even their age. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.small-business-software.net/the-emotion-of-color-in-web-design.htm" target="_blank" >Emotion of Color in Web Design</a>

<title>Link Gold</title>
<description>
Links are the threads that bind the web together. The Internet <i>web</i> is not so different from an actual spider web. Each page on the Internet is connected by an intricate system of links which connect websites to other websites.<br /> <br /> In order for a website to perform well in search engine rankings, it must have connections to other websites through links. These connections or links not only help search engines locate new content as it becomes available, but they also weave together networks of websites that are all related. The number and strength of connections that a website has will help determine the importance of that website. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.small-business-software.net/link-gold.htm" target="_blank" >Link Gold</a>

 Many webmasters fail to provide visitors clear and consistent navigation. Visitors will quickly become frustrated if they cannot easily find the information they are looking for.<br />

<title>2009 Recap, 2010 Predictions</title>
<description>
Another year has rolled by marked by miracles, political milestones and tragedies alike. 2009 was the year of financial uproar with bailouts and ponzi schemes dominating the news on a regular basis. Chrysler and GM stalwart car giants struggled to survive. Bernie Madoffs financial pyramid came tumbling down, taking average citizen's retirement plans with it, emptying the coffers of trusting non-profits and celebrities alike.<br /> <br /> The United States democratically dominated political landscape juggled health care reform, accusations of death boards, raucous town hall meetings and tea parties from coast to coast. The Swine Flu was quickly renamed H1N1 so that the pork industry would not suffer, and the politicized name change did little to calm pandemic worries.<br /> <br /> 2009 was also marred by a number of notable deaths. Farrah Fawcett, the charming Charlies Angel, battle with cancer came to an end. The controversial but talented Michael Jackson succumbed to what appeared to be a fatal drug cocktail. Eunice Kennedy Shriver, known for the creation of the Special Olympics, passed on. Ted Kennedy, the patriarch of the Kennedy clan, and another controversial and historic figure, succumbed in his battle against a brain tumor. Walter Cronkite, the most trusted voice in America, died, bringing about the end of an era in journalism. Patrick Swayze who danced his way into our hearts, left us with nothing but sadness over his untimely death. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.small-business-software.net/2009-reflections-2010-predictions.htm" target="_blank" >2009 Reflections, 2010 Predictions</a>

<title>Twitter for Business</title>
<description>
Follow us at <a href="http://twitter.com/feedforall" target="_blank" >@FeedForAll</a> on Twitter.<br /> <br /> Businesses can use Twitter as a marketing tool in a variety of ways. Many business owners struggle with social media as a marketing medium. At the heart of the most effective social media marketing campaigns is personal communication. Many businesses that try to manage social media may attempt to shout their message, rather than simply engaging with potential customers. Potential customers who are active in social networks will not be receptive to marketing in this fashion. The trick with social media like Twitter is to interact and engage, rather than shouting your message.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.small-business-software.net/twitter.htm" target="_blank" >Twitter for Business</a>

 <b>Sound Effects: The Power of Audio</b><br />
 Sound effects are often used to compliment and enhance artistic presentations, whether they be podcasts, videos, or other audio visual productions. Royalty-free sound effects are typically non-exclusive and can be used by anyone who purchases them. Professional sound effects can give a podcast or production a more professional sound. However, many new producers may not realize that sound effects have copyrights, and in many cases it is illegal to use a sound effect that you happen to find on the web without properly licensing it.<br />

<title>Green Business Tips</title>
<description>
Businesses that are <i>going green </i>are becoming more and more commonplace. Regardless of your political beliefs or opinions regarding the <i>global warming </i>concept, few can argue that being environmentally aware will leave the world a better place. Whether a company is simply jumping on the green bandwagon, or are honestly sensitive about environmental issues is really irrelevant. Consumers like green businesses, and shaping your business to promote being "eco-friendly" makes sense from a public relations standpoint. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.notepage.net/green/green-business-tips.htm" target="_blank" >Green Business Tips</a>

<title>Search Engine Optimization for PDFs</title>
<description>
Google, Yahoo, and MSN can all spider and index text-based PDF files, and generally they rank quite well. PDF files can be used to seize top listings for important keywords and keyword phrases. In order to have a PDF effectively rank well in organic searches, it should be optimized for the search engines, just as you would optimize a web page. Optimization of PDF files for search engines is very similar to search engine optimization for other types of content... <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.small-business-software.net/pdf-seo.htm" target="_blank" >Optimize PDF Files For Search Engines</a>

<title>Businesses Going Green</title>
<description>
We have been making an effort to Go Green, thought this might help some of our customers:<br /> <br /> A business that makes the decision to be environmentally-conscious will often promote goodwill among potential customers, while making the world a better place for future generations. Many businesses hesitate to adopt green practices because they fear it will hurt their bottom line and negatively impact profits. But many eco-conscious businesses discover that they can actually save money and bring in new customers who specifically patronize companies that actively make an effort to be environmentally friendly. Many customers may even be willing to pay a bit more for a product or service from a company that is green.<br /> <br /> Many businesses already do things that are eco-friendly, not necessarily because they are sensitive to green living, but simply to save money. That does not, however, diminish the value of their green efforts. The trick for businesses is to be eco-friendly without compromising profitability.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.notepage.net/steps-businesses-can-take-to-go-green.htm" target="_blank" >Tips for Businesses Going Green</a>

<title>Where to Find Sound Effects</title>
<description>
Royalty-free sound effect libraries contain thousands of sound effects that can be licensed for specific uses. A customer who uses royalty-free sound effects, as opposed to hiring a sound engineer to create them from scratch, can save considerable time, effort, and money. Typically, podcasters and other content producers can obtain non-exclusive rights to a single effect, or they can purchase a subscription of sorts. The subscriptions allow publishers to download a limited number of sound effects during a specified period of time.<br /> <br /> Here are a few sources for <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/where-to-locate-sound-effects.htm" target="_blank" >Sound Effects</a>... <br /> <br />

<title>What Can be Published Using RSS Feeds</title>
<description>
With all the vast amounts of information available on the web, it is becoming more and more difficult to sort through and find what you are looking for. RSS significantly lowers the signal-to-noise ratio. RSS has the unique ability to compile information and filter it, so you only see unique and relevant content. The information superhighway has become packed with content, and those familiar with technology are using RSS to filter the content, allowing them to drill down and access only the content they want, without having to wade through all the noise. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/what-can-be-published-using-rss.htm" target="_blank" >What Can be Published Using RSS Feeds?</a>

There are a wide variety of social media channels and networks available.<br /> <br /> Social networks and social media websites are community-driven websites that allow visitors to submit items of interest.

<title>What Exactly is Podcasting?</title>
<description>
The term <i>podcast</i> was initially used to reference an RSS feed that contained audio files in the items enclosure field. The meaning of podcasting has since expanded, and now refers to RSS feeds that contain all types of media, including audio and video, in the items enclosure field. For the non-technical folks, podcasting is simply a means of syndicating and distributing rich-media files via the Internet. The content contained in a podcast can vary significantly, from a song, to a educational lecture, to a political debate, to just about anything else. One great thing about podcasting is the wide variety of content formats it can contain. And unlike radio or television broadcasts, the recipient can listen or view at their leisure, choosing for themselves when and where they wish to listen or view a podcast. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/what-exactly-is-podcasting.htm" target="_blank" >What Exactly is Podcasting?</a>

 <b>HTML Web Template Options </b><br />
 HTML website templates can significantly ease the burden of designing and creating websites by providing webmasters with a ready-made web layout, structure, basic graphics, and color scheme. Templates can generally be edited and customized with any HTML editor. The biggest advantage for webmasters using ready-made templates is the amount of time that can be saved. There are a number of websites that provide ready-made HTML templates. We have compiled a list of some popular sites to make the search process easier. <br />

<title>Internet Marketing Resolutions</title>
<description>
Starting a New Year is all about self-reflecting. Most individuals celebrate the incoming year by looking back, determining what goals were met and what goals fell short. Most who have made past resolutions then look forward and resolve to do better in the coming year. <br /> <br /> Like any Internet marketer, I have a long laundry list of things that I intend to get to... invariably each year the list grows longer, and rarely do I make any significant headway on new projects, ideas, or marketing techniques. I resolve for that to change in 2008! I have compiled a list of Internet Marketing resolutions for the coming year. If your list is already too long, consider saving time and using the list below. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.small-business-software.net/2008-internet-marketing-resolutions.htm" target="_blank" >Internet Marketing Resolutions</a>

<title>Technology in 2008</title>
<description>
The lens through which viewers receive their news has changed. The images of struggle are no longer frozen in time; technology has helped preserve and personalize these conflicts by producing moving tributes to the conflicts of humankind. <br /> <br /> The strife and internal conflicts that marred the globe in 2006 continued into 2007: Mynamar (Burma), Palestine and Lebanon all continue to struggle with internal conflicts in their borders. The differences between 2006 and 2007 are not obvious; however, under close examination, it is evident that several external struggles have been transformed into internal conflicts. In 2006, many countries attempted to influence their neighbors. This was evident with Iran attempting to influence the turmoil in Iraq, and Syria attempting to control Lebanon. Both struggles have evolved into internal personal conflicts in 2007. <br /> <br /> While video is not a new technology, the spread of video-viewing technology in devices like the iPod has brought the faces of terror into the homes of the western world. Advances in technology have also encouraged the West to open both their hearts and wallets, with many sponsoring children like Youseff, a child with a horribly scarred face. The same technology that brought Youssef's story to millions of homes, also helped bring tragedies like the Virginia Tech massacres. <br /> <br /> In 2007, the heavy reliance on technology forced censorship and spying to the forefront of concerns. Many western countries accused the communist nation, China, of cyber snooping and hacking. Also, Russia did not remain unscathed in 2007, with widespread suspicion and accusations following the death of Alexander Litvinenko in late 2006. On a more positive note, North Korea seems to have complacently agreed to nuclear compliance. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.small-business-software.net/2008-predictions.htm" target="_blank" >Technology in 2008</a>

 <b><i>The Influence of Technology on Politics</i></b><br />
 Americans have always had a say in their government, at least in theory. Since the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, the United States of America has been the <i>land of opportunity</i>, where even a lowly log-splitter, exercising sufficient brains and dedication, can raise himself to the highest executive office. <br />
 <br />
 The U.S. Constitution safeguards the right to vote for every citizen over eighteen years of age, with few exceptions, ensuring a government of the people, by the people and for the people. Nevertheless, only about half of eligible voters historically vote for their president. Those who do make it to the polls are more educated than unschooled, more white than black, more men than women, more wealthy than poor, and more old than young. <br />

<title>Influence of Technology on Politics</title>
<description>
The staggering distribution numbers, through channels like iTunes, YouTube, or podcasting websites, indicate that technology could play a critical role in the upcoming elections. Technology could be the deciding factor in the 2008 US Presidential race, and while distribution has never before been as accessible as it is to today's politicians and political candidates, politicians have far less control over the news and media than their counterparts in previous years. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/influence-of-technology.htm" target="_blank" >The Influence of Technology on Politics</a>

The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their inspiration originated for their content. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.small-business-software.net/how-to-get-ideas.htm" target="_blank" >How to Get Ideas for Blog Posts</a>

 Ian Muth, sales manager for FeedForAll.com, says adding your content to an RSS feed can be as easy as entering the title, description and URL into software offered by his company and other suppliers, and uploading it to a Web server.<br />

<title>Syndicating Inventory</title>
<description>
While syndicating inventory is not a new concept, as it feeds for Amazon and eBay have been available for quite some time we are seeing more and more specialty houses offer RSS feeds for their stock.<br /> <br /> Taking it a step further if RSS is not something your storefront currently offers consider using a script like <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/sql2rss.htm" target="_blank" >SQL2RSS</a> to create an inventory feed. It will update realtime and show only what is available in the database.

<title>7 Day Software Highlights FeedForAll</title>
<description>
In the modern world of 2007 fewer and fewer people are building the XML representation of an RSS feed&nbsp;&nbsp;by hand as most blogging and podcasting software now handles this function. However, if you're a software developer, want full control over your feed or you are doing something somewhat out-of-the-ordinary with RSS, as we do at <a href="http://www.projectglidepath.net" target="_blank" >Project Glidepath</a>, you need the tool we use, <a href="http://www.feedforall.com" target="_blank" >FeedForAll</a>, which creates, edits, uploads, downloads, and even error checks RSS data; a tremendous time saver.<br /> <br /> Created by the folks at NotePage, Inc., a MicroISV based in Hannover, MA, FeedForAll, which is available for both Windows and Mac, is the<b> ultimate tool for hand-rolling RSS feeds</b>. It gracefully handles all of the date-stamp issues (which is a *big* deal), understands all the iTunes XML idiosyncrasies as well as includes a WYSIWYG HTML editor you can use to edit the description fields and even has built-in image editing functions.<br />

<a href="http://www.recordforall.com" target="_blank" >RecordForAll</a> was nominated for the 2007 SIA Award for the Best Sound Program or Utility! <br /> <br /> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.feedforall.com/07nominee.gif"><br /> <br /> The <a href="http://www.siavoting.com/sia.php" target="_blank" >Shareware Industry Awards</a> were created as a way to honor the very best programs marketed using the "shareware" marketing model. In those early days it was often an up-hill battle, but the small software authors persevered. Over time, the number of companies using the "shareware" model has increased dramatically. Today nearly all software companies use the "shareware" marketing model whether they use the term or not. This fact stands as a tribute to the many pioneers who braved new ground in the name of "shareware." These pages are a testimony to where we've been, where we are, and just how far we've come. The Shareware Industry Awards are dedicated to excellence in software.

rview goes off without a hitch. <br />
 <br />
 <b><i>1. Prepare Questions in Advance </i></b><br />
 Prepare a list of questions prior to the interview, contemplate possible follow-up questions based on the expected responses. Create a list of notes along with the questions that are accessible during the interview and will help you direct the conversation. <br />
 <br />
 <b><i>2. Research Interview Subject</i></b><br />
 Do your homework about the individual or individuals you are interviewing. A little due diligence will go a long way. Search newsgroups and Google for the interviewees name, product, or company, and build a background. The research will help predict the interviewees responses to your questions. Listen to previous interviews in which the interviewee participated, read their blog and articles to get a feel for the interviewees position on issues. <br />

 <br />
 <i>The most technical information you will need to get started: your Web site server address and FTP server type. If you have your own in-house server hosting your Web site, you can get that information easily from your Web software (or better, from your IT guy). But more than likely, you are using an outside service provider to host your site, so you’ll need to get that info from them. </i><br />
 <br />
 <i>Before you panic, or spend time on hold waiting for tech support, drill down into the Web-hosting details area in your account-management screen, and you should be able to find the server address assigned to your site. Just be aware that some low-cost hosting subscriptions don’t provide FTP support (which you need to upload your feed), so you may need to upgrade your hosting account.</i><br />
 <br />
 <i>In FeedforAll, the first step in the RSS creation wizard is to give your feed a title. If there is (or will be) a Web page that will also contain the information provided in the RSS feed, use the same name. Then, you’ll be asked to fill in a description. This is a short summary that aptly describes the contents of the feed. You’ll also enter the link to the feed; that is, the Web page URL from which the RSS feed originates.</i>

<title>Where to Locate Podsafe Music</title>
<description>
Nothing really polishes a podcast more than background music or theme music. In the music world, these music segments are referred to as intros and extros. While many enjoy streaming Internet Audio and recording songs they like over the Internet, these songs cannot legally be used in a podcast. <br /> <br /> <b>PodSafe Music </b><br /> Podsafe music refers to music specifically for podcasters. The music is licensed in such a way that podcasters can purchase a license to include the music in a podcast without incurring additional fees or expenses. In order to use traditional music that is heard on the radio in a podcast, podcasters may have to pay royalties for each time the song is played. Some music files licensed under public domain or creative commons are exempt from royalties and these songs are available for use in a podcast, but generally when searching for music to include in a podcast it is probably best to stick with music that is specifically designated as "podsafe". <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/how-to-locate-podsafe-music.htm" target="_blank" >Where to find Podsafe Music</a><br />

<title>Monetizing Podcasts</title>
<description>
Podcasts started out as fun ways for ambitious garage DJs, independent musicians and talk show hosts, who had not ventured into radio broadcasting as a way to show their stuff and make a name for themselves. What started as a hobby for many, has turned into a lucrative profession for some. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, podcasters, just like radio stations, have looked for ways to profit from their on-air dialogue. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/monetizing-podcasts.htm" target="_blank" >Monetizing Podcasts</a>

<title>Podcast Audio Recording Tips</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
When you are producing a podcast on a regular basis it is important that you select an appropriate location for the recording to take place. The location should be free of external distractions and relatively quiet. It is easiest if you use the same location each time, that way the equipment can rem

ain in place and will not require moving or setup each time you produce a show. <br />
 <br />
 The room should have a carpet or furniture that will absorb echoes and dampen the sound. The room should also have a door, so that you will not have unexpected interruptions. Reduce extraneous noise by turning off fans or any equipment. Consider hanging a note on the door, so that you will not be disturbed while recording. <br />
 <b><i></i></b><br />
 <b><i>Recording Away from Home </i></b><br />
 When taking your podcast on the road it is equally important that the quality of the podcast is not compromised for the sake of portability. Consider using a directional microphone or finding a quiet alcove for interviews when on the road. <br />

 <b>What RSS Is Not; RSS Does Not Equal Email </b><br />
 RSS is not email, nor is it designed to be a replacement for email. RSS is a supplemental communication channel that can be used to deliver content. Email newsletters have had an increasing problem with spam. Email open rates have plummeted, filtering systems have become increasingly complex and with the complexity and volume even "approved" messages have been unable to get through. <br />

<title>Free RSS Auto Discovery Code Generator</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
Increase the number of RSS subscribers by adding <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/autodiscovery.htm" target="_blank">autodiscovery code</a> to your website. NotePage has made a free online tool that automates the creation of the auto-discovery code for RSS feeds. <br />
 <br />
 The free auto-discovery tool automatically creates the code necessary for the auto-discovery of RSS feeds on a website. Simply enter the title, and the URL of the RSS feed and A code will then be generated based on the information entered. The code can then be entered in the "header" section of an HTML web page, to assist RSS readers in automatically detecting the precense of an RSS feed for that website. <br />
 <br />
 Many RSS Readers can automatically discover that an RSS feed is available for a specific website and notify the website visitor if the auto-discovery code is in place. Browsers and aggregators including FireFox, Safari and IE 7 are just a few applications that will take advanteage of the precense of RSS auto-discovery code. <br />
 <br />
 The RSS auto discovery tool can be accessed by clicking the following url <a href="http://www.feedforall.com/autodiscovery.htm" target="_blank">http://www.feedforall.com/autodiscovery.htm</a><br />

<title>Webmaster Tips</title>
<description>
According to Matt Cutts, there are over 100 factors that affect search engine ranking. For those of you who don't know, Matt is a Google guy guru, he is employed by Google but writes an independent blog and shares information related to Google and search engine optimization. Unfortunately, of those 100 items that account for search engine ranking, there are only a few that webmasters can actually control. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a interested in an exercise of futility, it is important to only focus on those ranking factors that you, as a webmaster, can control and influence. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.small-business-software.net/webmaster-tips.htm" target="_blank" >Webmaster Tips</a>

<title>Kudos for FeedForAll</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
This was posted on a customers blog: <br />
 <br />
 <i>For those of us who know enough to be dangerous, but probably should not be writing our own code, Feed for All comes to the rescue to write your RSS Feeds.</i><br />
 <i></i><br />
 <i>An RSS feed is an index of your website, your blog, or in my case: a video podcast. To post your podcasts to iTunes, you must supply an RSS feed in a certain format for the iTunes store to list your podcast properly. When you post new content to your site, the RSS feed must be updated. For most blogs, this is done automatically. For iTunes, one must do it manually. </i><br />

<title>New Medical Feeds Directory</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<a href="http://www.feedforall.com" target="_blank">FeedForAll</a> has sponsored a new <a href="http://www.medical-feeds.com" target="_blank">medical feeds directory</a>. <br>
 <br>
 As demand for RSS feeds grow, medical feeds continue to be one of the more popular content themes. In order to accomm
]]>
<![CDATA[
odate this demand, a new medical and health feed website directory has been created. As the demand for the medium increases, topical directories are the next step in helping searchers to connect with the medical information they are looking for. <br>
 <br>
 As RSS becomes more mainstream, finding specific medical feeds is becoming increasingly more difficult. A recent search for medical feeds in a popular search engine produced over one hundred and eighty million results. Narrowing the search to just diabetes feeds still came up with almost twenty million hits. Navigating through so many websites to find actual medical feeds is not only time consuming but also difficult. This is the reason that the medical feeds directory was created, to simplify the search process and connect users with medical and health feeds of interest. <br>
 <br>
 The website is dedicated to only medical and health feeds, making it easy to find RSS feeds on almost medical condition or disease. Users can search or use topic headings to locate the medical information that they are looking for. Hard to find items for obscure or unusual medical conditions are also available. The <a href="http://www.medical-feeds.com" target="_blank">medical-feeds.com</a> directory is a dynamic website that is constantly updating with the newest feed items. Allowing medical institutions s to add their feeds to the directory as they become available.<br>
 <br>
 The directory can be found at <a href="http://www.medical-feeds.com" target="_blank">http://www.medical-feeds.com</a>

<title>Questioning Online Credibility</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<i>Credibility online is becoming more and more of an issue. Anyone can have a blog or post to a forum and anyone can edit wiki entries. Web surfers are beginning to comprehend that just because it is in print does not necessarily mean that it is true. In fact, in today's online world, the collective truth might be the closest thing we can get to the real truth. Peer policing and social bookmarking have become common in the online world. </i><br>
 <i></i><br>
 <i>Human nature invariably prompts a level of trust;if it is written, it must be true. We live in a generation where we expect authors, editors and publishers that are qualified to write on various topics. What qualifications are required to post a blog, write an online article, or edit a wiki? Some web surfers may find the answer startling: None.</i><br>

<title>iTunes New Categories</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
Apple launched a revised set of categories for podcasts listed in the iTunes Music Store.<br>

 <i>Most of the old categories and subcategories are now automatically mapped to corresponding ones within the new system. For example, if your podcast was listed under "Arts & Entertainment &gt; Phot

ography", it will now appear under "Arts> Visual Arts." However, 3 categories have been removed and do not have a similar replacement: "International", "Talk Radio", and "Public Radio". Those categories overlapped with others in the old system, making some podcasts difficult to find. If one of these categories is listed as the first subject in your podcast feed, that category information will be ignored and the second category will be used to determine eligibility and placement in that feature page.</i><br>
 <i></i><br>
 <i>Changes to your categories may take 1-2 weeks from the time you edit your feed, so please review and add new category data as soon as possible to ensure your podcast is listed appropriately. New categories and subcategories that did not exist in the old browse structure will appear as podcasts are mapped to them.</i><br>
